## 🛠️ Local Setup

Follow these steps to run the portfolio locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal_portfolio.git
cd personal_portfolio
```

### 2. Install dependencies (frontend + backend)

```bash
npm run install-all
```

Or manually:

```bash
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
```

---

### 3. Create Environment Variables

You need environment variables for both backend and frontend.

#### Backend `.env` (inside `/backend`)

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Frontend `.env` (inside `/frontend`)

```env
VITE_EXPRESS_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 4. Run Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both:

- Express backend  
- Vite frontend  

---

### 5. Production Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```
